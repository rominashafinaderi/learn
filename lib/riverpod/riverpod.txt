Make your first provider/network request

flutter pub add riverpod

////Setting up ProviderScope

void main() {
  runApp(
    // This should not be inside "MyApp" but as direct parameter to "runApp".
    ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

////Performing your network request in a "provider"

Performing a network request is usually what we call "business logic".
They behave like normal functions, with the added benefits of:
Being cached
Offering default error/loading handling
Being listenable
Automatically re-executing when some data changes

////Defining the model

crating  the activity model for this josn by freezed package
{
  "key": "12345",
  "activity": "پیاده‌روی در پارک",
  "type": "outdoor",
  "participants": 2,
  "price": 0.0
}
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

////Creating the provider

The syntax for defining a provider is as followed:

@riverpod
Result myFunction(Ref ref) {
  <your logic here>
}

@riverpod is annotation
Annotated functions must specify a "ref" as first parameter.
Besides that, the function can have any number of parameters, including generics. The function is also free to return a Future/Stream if it wishes to.

This function will be called when the provider is first read.
Subsequent reads will not call the function again, but instead return the cached value.
